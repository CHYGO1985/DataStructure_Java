/**
 * The implementaiton of Prim's algorithm to calculate the minimum spannning tree.
 * The tricky part of this code is to use two array: one to keep prefix of each vertex in the spanning tree, and one
 * to keep the min cost to connect to the vertex in the spanning tree set. This use avoid traditional method (like using set)
 * to keep the vertext in the spanning tree set, and then each round will need to iterate through the set to get a vertex A, 
 * then iterate through all the vertex that A connects to, in order to get the lowest weight.
